# LU Factorization with Partial Pivoting

LuFactor.m takes a givin square matrix A, and performs a LU Factorization without using matlabs built in function.

Inputs
* A - Coefficient Matrix 

Outputs
* L - Lower Triangular Matrix
* U - Upper Triangular Matrix
* P - Pivot Matrix

Variable P is used to track the pivots which make a smooth factorization.
