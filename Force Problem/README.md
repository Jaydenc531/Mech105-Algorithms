# Force Root Finding Problem
Model.PNG shows a box of mass m = 25 kg being pulled by a rope. The force required move the box is given by ForceEquation.PNG.

ForceRoot.m solves for angle theta when the pull force equals 150N and plots the function depending on theta.

Given 
* u = 0.55
* g = 9.81 m/s^2

The bicection function included in matlab is used to solve.
