# Volume In Tank 
The tank in a water tower has the geometry shown in the figure (the lower part is a cylinder and the upper part is an inverted frustum of a cone). Inside the tank there is a float that indicates the level of the water. 

VolumeInTank.m determines the volume of the water in the tank from the position (height h) of the float while detecting values incorrect values of h outside the bounds of the given tank (modelTank.PNG).
