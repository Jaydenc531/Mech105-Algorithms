# Integration Using Simpsons 1/3 Rule

Simpson.m evaluates the integral of the vector function values 'y' with respect to 'x'.
The function has to check for equally spaced inputs of x and confirm the same number of values for 'x' and 'y'.
The simpsons 1/3 rule requires that the number of intervals are even. If false, a single application of the trapazoid rule on the last interval is added to the final answer and noted in the output.
