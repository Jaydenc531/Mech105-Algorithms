# Simple Electrical Circuit
Using equation.PNG

Where
* t = time
* q0 = Initial Charge
* R = The Resistance
* L = The Inductance
* C = The Capacitance

SCircuit.m will generate a plot of equation.PNG from t = 0 to t = 0.8 for C = 0.00005 and subplot when C is 10x greater.
The plot is formated with appropriete axis labels.

Given
* q0 = 10
* R = 60
* L = 9
* C = 0.00005
